## TABLE VIEW (1:05 - 1:35)

**[Screen: Historical Sales Data table view]**

At the top, you have a product selector dropdown."

**[Click dropdown and select different products]**

"You can easily switch between products - let's look at Pharmaceutical Grade DHNA-M, then Chemical Intermediate DHNA-M, and Performance Material DHNA-M. Each product shows detailed breakdowns by plant location, geographical area, fiscal year, and sales figures in millions of dollars.

This table view is perfect for detailed data inspection, reporting, or if you prefer working with raw numbers before diving into visual analytics."

"The AI-powered forecasting engine processes historical trends, seasonal variations, and market patterns."

You can hover over any point to see detailed values, including the confidence range for forecasted data."

## ADDITIONAL CHARTS (2:55 - 3:15)

- **Opportunities** - suggesting expansion possibilities and optimization strategies

Each insight is categorized by severity level - high, medium, or low - so you can prioritize your actions.
